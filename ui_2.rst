17. Case Studies and Practical Examples

Case 1: Reducing Job Execution Time from 30 mins to 10 mins
Scenario: A Spark job was taking 30 minutes due to excessive shuffling.

Solution:

Increased shuffle partitions (spark.sql.shuffle.partitions = 300).
Used broadcast joins.
Optimized executor memory allocation.
Result: Job execution time reduced to 10 minutes.

Case 2: Fixing OOM Errors in a Large Dataset Processing Job
Scenario: Job failed with OOM errors while processing a large dataset.

Solution:

Increased executor-memory and executor-cores.
Used coalesce() to manage partitions.
Enabled Garbage Collection (GC) tuning.
Increased shuffle memory fraction.
Result: Job ran successfully without OOM errors.
