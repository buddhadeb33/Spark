Enabling and Accessing Spark UI History
========================================
Enable Spark History Server
---------------------------
To track job execution after completion, enable the **Spark History Server**:

Standalone or YARN Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Start the History Server:
   .. code-block:: sh

      ./sbin/start-history-server.sh

2. Open the UI in a browser:
   .. code-block::

      http://<history-server-host>:18080

3. Configure logging in ``spark-defaults.conf``:
   .. code-block::

      spark.eventLog.enabled true
      spark.eventLog.dir hdfs:///spark-logs
      spark.history.fs.logDirectory hdfs:///spark-logs

AWS Glue
^^^^^^^^
1. Enable **continuous logging** in AWS Glue jobs.
2. Access the **Spark UI** via **AWS Glue Spark UI Monitoring** or **CloudWatch Logs Insights**.

Understanding Spark UI Components
===================================
The **Spark UI History Server** consists of multiple components, each serving a critical role in understanding job execution and performance bottlenecks. Below are the key components:

Jobs Tab
--------
- Displays a list of **all jobs** run in the application.
- Provides job **start time, duration, and status** (Succeeded, Failed, Running).
- Helps in identifying **slow-running or failed jobs**.

Stages Tab
----------
- Breaks down jobs into **multiple stages** based on transformation boundaries.
- Shows **input data size, shuffle read/write, and task execution details**.
- Highlights **skewed tasks** and **long-running stages**.

Tasks Tab
---------
- Displays individual **task execution metrics** within a stage.
- Useful for identifying **straggler tasks** and **high GC overhead**.

DAG Visualization
-----------------
- Provides a **graphical representation** of the job execution plan.
- Helps in detecting **wide transformations** (expensive operations like ``groupByKey()``, ``join()``).
- Allows users to **track dependencies** between different operations.

Executors Tab
-------------
- Displays a summary of **CPU usage, memory consumption, and GC time** per executor.
- Identifies **idle or over-utilized executors**.
- Helps in diagnosing **executor failures and memory leaks**.

Storage Tab
-----------
- Shows **persisted RDDs and DataFrames**.
- Displays **memory usage** of cached datasets.
- Helps in deciding whether **to cache/unpersist data** efficiently.

Environment Tab
---------------
- Lists **Spark configurations, Java environment settings, and system properties**.
- Useful for debugging **configuration mismatches and tuning parameters**.

SQL Tab (For DataFrames)
------------------------
- Displays **query execution plans**.
- Provides details on **broadcast joins, filters, and aggregations**.
- Helps in identifying **suboptimal query patterns**.

---

Common Performance Bottlenecks and Solutions
============================================
Small File Issue
----------------
**Problem:** Too many small files lead to excessive metadata operations.

**Solution:**

- Use ``coalesce()`` to reduce the number of partitions:
  .. code-block:: python

      df.coalesce(10).write.parquet("output")

- Optimize file formats (e.g., **Parquet** over **CSV**).

Large Shuffle Operations
------------------------
**Problem:** Heavy shuffle operations increase job execution time.

**Solution:**

- Use **broadcast joins** if one dataset is small:
  .. code-block:: python

      from pyspark.sql.functions import broadcast
      df_join = df1.join(broadcast(df2), "id")

- Increase shuffle partitions:
  .. code-block:: python

      spark.conf.set("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", 200)

Data Skew
---------
**Problem:** Uneven data distribution across partitions.

**Solution:**

- Use **salting** to distribute skewed keys.
- Increase shuffle partitions (``spark.sql.shuffle.partitions``).
- Use **Adaptive Query Execution (AQE)**:
  .. code-block:: python

      spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.enabled", True)

Out of Memory (OOM) Errors
--------------------------
**Problem:** Executors run out of memory and tasks fail.

**Solution:**

- Increase executor memory:
  .. code-block:: sh

      --executor-memory 8G

- Optimize Spark memory configurations:
  .. code-block:: sh

      --conf spark.memory.fraction=0.8
      --conf spark.memory.storageFraction=0.5

- Tune garbage collection:
  .. code-block:: sh

      --conf spark.executor.extraJavaOptions="-XX:+UseG1GC -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=35"

- Increase **shuffle memory fraction** to avoid excessive spills:
  .. code-block:: sh

      --conf spark.shuffle.spill.compress=false
      --conf spark.shuffle.memoryFraction=0.6

Slow Queries in Spark SQL
-------------------------
**Problem:** Queries take too long to execute.

**Solution:**

- Use **column pruning** (``select()`` instead of ``*``).
- Push **filter conditions down** to the source:
  .. code-block:: python

      df = spark.read.parquet("data.parquet").filter("date >= '2024-01-01'")

- Enable **bucketing and partitioning** for large tables.
- Use **cache()** to speed up repeated queries:
  .. code-block:: python

      df.cache()

---

AWS Glue-Specific Optimizations
=================================
Use Dynamic Frames Efficiently
------------------------------
- Convert to **DataFrame** when using SQL transformations:
  .. code-block:: python

      df = dynamic_frame.toDF()

Optimize S3 Reads and Writes
----------------------------
- Use **partitioning** to avoid scanning unnecessary files.
- Enable **pushdown predicates** for filtering.

Enable AWS Glue Job Bookmarks
-----------------------------
- Allows incremental processing instead of reprocessing entire datasets.

---

Case Studies and Practical Examples
====================================
Case 1: Reducing Job Execution Time from 30 mins to 10 mins
----------------------------------------------------------
**Scenario:** A Spark job was taking 30 minutes due to excessive shuffling.

**Solution:**

- Increased shuffle partitions (``spark.sql.shuffle.partitions = 300``).
- Used **broadcast joins**.
- Optimized **executor memory allocation**.

**Result:** Job execution time reduced to 10 minutes.

Case 2: Fixing OOM Errors in a Large Dataset Processing Job
----------------------------------------------------------
**Scenario:** Job failed with OOM errors while processing a large dataset.

**Solution:**

- Increased ``executor-memory`` and ``executor-cores``.
- Used ``coalesce()`` to manage partitions.
- Enabled **Garbage Collection (GC) tuning**.
- Increased shuffle memory fraction.

**Result:** Job ran successfully without OOM errors.

2. Navigating the Spark UI Components
The Spark UI consists of several tabs, each providing specific information:

Jobs Tab: Displays a summary of all jobs in the application, including their status, duration, and the number of stages and tasks.

Stages Tab: Breaks down jobs into stages, showing details like the number of tasks, input and output data sizes, and shuffle information.

Tasks Tab: Provides granular information about individual tasks within a stage, including execution time, GC time, and errors if any.

Storage Tab: Shows RDDs that are cached, their storage levels, and memory usage.

Environment Tab: Lists Spark properties, environment variables, classpath entries, and system properties.

Executors Tab: Provides metrics for each executor, such as memory and disk usage, task and shuffle read/write metrics, and garbage collection statistics.

SQL Tab: Displays details about executed SQL queries, including their execution plans and metrics.

3. Identifying Performance Bottlenecks and Errors
Long-Running Stages or Tasks: In the Stages and Tasks tabs, sort by duration to identify stages or tasks that are taking longer than expected. Long durations may indicate issues like data skew or inefficient operations.

Shuffle Read/Write Size: High shuffle read/write sizes in the Stages tab can indicate expensive operations like wide transformations (e.g., joins, aggregations). Optimizing these operations or adjusting the number of partitions can help reduce shuffle costs.

Executor Utilization: The Executors tab provides insights into executor performance. Executors with high task failure rates or excessive garbage collection times may need more memory or require code optimization to handle data more efficiently.

Failed Tasks: The Tasks tab highlights any failed tasks. Reviewing the error messages can help diagnose issues such as memory shortages or data inconsistencies.

SQL Query Performance: In the SQL tab, examine the execution plans of slow queries. Identifying operations like expensive joins or scans can guide optimizations, such as adding appropriate indexes or restructuring queries.
